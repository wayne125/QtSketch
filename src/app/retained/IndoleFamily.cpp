// All entries use the 6-5 ortho-fused bicyclic skeleton (9 atoms) with two
// bridgehead atoms (degree 3).
//
// Each SMILES was empirically verified to place N atoms at the correct
// atom indices matching their chemical locant positions, using the same
// rigor as Task 2 (quinoline family): tiny Indigo-linked scratch programs
// were built and run for each candidate SMILES, parsing the SMILES,
// iterating atoms, and printing each atom's element (indigoAtomicNumber)
// and degree (indigoDegree) in order.
//
// For each entry, bridgehead positions (degree 3 atoms) were confirmed to
// land at the index positions the locant list expects, and heteroatoms
// (N) confirmed to land at the index(es) the locant list maps to the
// chemically-correct locant.

    //    indole numbering: N-1, C-2, C-3, C-3a (bridgehead), C-4, C-5, C-6,
    //    C-7, C-7a (bridgehead) -- with the ring CLOSING bond being 7a-1,
    //    i.e. N-1's bridgehead neighbor is 7a, NOT 3a (3a is reached going
    //    the OTHER way around, via C-2/C-3 first).

    // (0-1,0-8,1-2,2-3,3-4,3-8,4-5,5-6,6-7,7-8):
    //   atom[2]=N, neighbors atom[1] and atom[3] (both real bonds).
    //   atom[3] and atom[8] are the two bridgeheads (degree 3), directly
    //   bonded to each other (the 3-8 edge is the ring-fusion bond).

    // CORRECTED (the originally-dispatched version swapped the 3a/7a
    // labels, and consequently mirrored the whole 4-5-6-7 sequence --
    // caught by independently re-deriving the full peripheral walk from
    // the real bond list, not just confirming bridgeheads exist and N is
    // adjacent to one of them: that check alone is not enough to tell
    // WHICH bridgehead label -- 3a or 7a -- the adjacent one should get).
    // Walking the real locant sequence 1-2-3-3a-4-5-6-7-7a(-1 closing)
    // against the real bonds gives: atom[2]=1, atom[1]=2, atom[0]=3,

    //    ortho-fused bicyclics; requires separate research to verify the correct numbering.

    // 5. pyrrolizine: 5-5 fused with bridgehead nitrogen (8 atoms total).
    //    SMILES c1ccn2cc1cc2 verified (8 atoms, 1N at bridgehead atom[3] deg=3).
    //    Deferred: 5-5 fused system with bridgehead N is structurally different and
    //    requires separate research to verify the correct numbering.
