    // the full locant list directly, so this was cross-checked rather than
    // taken from one place):
    //   1. Rubrene's real IUPAC name is "5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene"
    //      (confirmed via a fresh web search of supplier/catalog listings
    //      giving this exact name) -- fixes the two meso-pair locants.
    //   2. "Tetracene-5,12-dione" is the standard/major tetracene quinone
    //      (ChEBI:51287, analogous to anthracene-9,10-dione) -- confirms
    //      5 and 12 are the two meso positions of the SAME inner ring
    //      (diagonally opposite within it), not of different rings.
    //   3. PubChem CID 12446083's IUPACName is
    //      "1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10-octahydrotetracene" (already independently
    //      confirmed this session for the ground-truth molecule) --
    //      confirms the two OUTER rings carry locants 1,2,3,4 and 7,8,9,10.
    //   4. IUPAC's own fused-ring-nomenclature Appendix 1 listing
    //      (iupac.qmul.ac.uk/fusedring/app1.html) places tetracene at
    //      table position 39, anthracene at 47, and naphthalene at 57 --
    //      consistently ONE MORE than this registry's own seniorityRank
    //      values for anthracene (46) and naphthalene (56), confirming
    //      the registry's seniorityRank = (that table position - 1), so
    //      tetracene's seniorityRank = 39 - 1 = 38 (more senior than
    //      anthracene/naphthalene, consistent with FR-2.3(b) "greater
    //      number of rings" -- 4 rings outranks 3 or 2).
    // These three facts, plus the standard ortho-fused-acene periphery-walk
    // pattern already used for naphthalene/anthracene above (each bridgehead
    // gets the previous number's own letter suffix), together fully pin
    // down the numbering below -- independently re-derived from first
    // principles AND cross-checked against all three facts simultaneously
    // (they are only mutually consistent with ONE locant assignment).
